## :computer: Objectives
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is the most used approach for software development and 
is already implemented by the most powerful programming languages. 
The OOP helps to combine into a single unit the data and the methods that operate 
on that data. So, every software developer should understand the basics and terminology related 
to OOP. Concepts such as classes and objects and the pillars of OOP: 
encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and reusability will be explored 
in this 21-day practise sequence.
